# YoloKeras-Detection

This project was developed by Ant√≥nio Pedro Silva Matos for object detection using the YOLO (You Only Look Once) and Keras (TensorFLow) models. The goal is to provide a unified platform to explore, test, and compare the performance of these models across diverse datasets and scenarios.
